# MRO-Resonance-Simulator

## Project Overview
This project provides a Python simulator for the Modèle de Résonance Ontogénétique (MRO), a theoretical model invented to formalize the birth and individuation processes of living and symbolic systems through oscillatory dynamics.

## Features
- Numerical resolution of coupled differential equations based on a second-order damped differential equation.
- Adjustable model parameters:
  - Metaphorical mass (`m`): represents system inertia.
  - Damping coefficient (`gamma`): controls internal dissipation.
  - Ontogenetic tension constant (`k`): sets intrinsic oscillation frequency.
- Visualization of damped oscillations illustrating the system's dynamic behaviour.

## Installation
Ensure Python 3.x is installed along with the dependencies:
